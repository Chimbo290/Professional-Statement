# Professional-Statement
My professional statement to show who I am as a personand as a potential employee and the value I bring to an organization

## 1. Use your own device to open a word processing document or application (or use a blank piece of paper).

## 2. Refer to your professional statement outline notes from step one and consider:

### a. What are your strengths (ones you currently have or plan to develop)?

My greatest strengths at the moment are my people skills. I currently am working on developing my time management skills, as I can usually have very busy days, and having to get all my atsks done in a timely manner is a challenge in it of itself.

### b. What are your values?

I value family. It's the biggest motivator behind what I do. At the end of the day, family is what keeps me grounded and pushes me to become the best version of myself I can be. I care for two younger siblings who need as much help and guidance as they can get.

### c. What interests you most about a career in cybersecurity?

Keeping people and data safe. Every day technology gets more and more powerful, but along with that it gets more and more dangerous. Someone needs to keep things in order to prevent malicious threat actors, and I'd like to be that someone.

### d. How can your strengths, values, and interest in cybersecurity support the security goals of various organizations?

Cybersecurity is all about keeping other people safe, and being able to respond effectively when that safety is at risk. Time is of the essence in the case of a security breach. Communication is critical in order to be able to fix any security breaches as they happen. Being a part of a team can almost feel like being a part of a family, and in my case, keeping family safe is the one thing I care most about. Nobody wants to see the safety of the peopl;e they care about at risk.

## 3. Draft a two- to three-sentence professional statement that includes details about your strengths, values, and interest in cybersecurity, as well as how they can support the security goals of various organizations.

I am a highly driven and adaptable property manager at a self-storage facility, where my biggest strengths include communication and time management. I believe that the most important thing in this world is family, and ensuring their safety no matter what. When it comes to cybersecurity, that is at the core of the values. Ensuring that others are kept safe, and if that safety were to ever be compromised, being able to communicate effectively and stopping any threats in a timely manner, to minimize loss.
