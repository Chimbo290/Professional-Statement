# Professional-Statement
My professional statement to show who I am as a personand as a potential employee and the value I bring to an organization

###I am a highly driven and adaptable property manager at a self-storage facility, where my biggest strengths include communication and time management. I believe that the most important thing in this world is family, and ensuring their safety no matter what. When it comes to cybersecurity, that is at the core of the values. Ensuring that others are kept safe, and if that safety were to ever be compromised, being able to communicate effectively and stopping any threats in a timely manner, to minimize loss.
